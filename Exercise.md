# Level 1: Basics

## Component Typing:

-   Create a functional React component with typed props for name and age (string and number respectively).
    Add a type annotation for the component's return value as JSX.

## State Typing:

-   Create a functional component with state typed as an object containing count (number) and showCount (boolean). Implement methods to manipulate the state with type safety.

## Prop Validation:

-   Define a custom type guard to validate incoming props for an input component, ensuring it's a string with a specific length. Use the guard to conditionally render an error message if the validation fails.

# Level 2: Intermediate

## Generics:

-   Create a generic Button component that accepts a generic type for the onClick handler function and renders a button with the appropriate click event type.

## Utility Types:

-   Use the Partial and Readonly utility types to create different view models from a complex data structure representing a user object.

## Custom Hooks:

-   Create a custom hook with typed input and output types that fetches data from an API and handles loading states with TypeScript.

# Level 3: Advanced

Conditional Types: Implement a component that renders different content based on a typed theme prop with light and dark options. Use conditional types to define the content type based on the theme.
Higher-Order Components (HOCs): Create a HOC that adds type safety to existing components by wrapping them and defining specific prop types.
Testing with Jest: Write Jest unit tests for your components and custom hooks, leveraging TypeScript to ensure type safety in the tests.
Bonus:

Implement a more complex application using React and TypeScript, demonstrating your understanding of advanced concepts like context, memoization, and Redux integration with type safety.
Contribute to open-source React projects that use TypeScript to gain practical experience and showcase your skills.
Remember:

Focus on understanding the rationale behind type annotations and how they improve code quality.
Practice consistently and gradually increase the complexity of your exercises.
Utilize resources like the official TypeScript documentation, React documentation, and online tutorials for deeper learning.
